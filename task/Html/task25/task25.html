            C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now
            a days ' for competitive programming. It has imperative,
            object-oriented and<br />
            generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like
            Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. C++ is an efficient and powerful
            language and<br />
            finds wide use in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and real-time
            simulations. Because of the inclusion of rich function libraries,
            working in C++<br />
            becomes simpler and convenient than C. Being object-oriented
            programming like Java, C++ provides the support of inheritance,
            polymorphism, <br />encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
            exception handling and function overloading.

            Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in
            programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement
            real-world <br />entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
            etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the
            data and the functions that operate<br />
            on them so that no other part of the code can access this data
            except that function.

            <span class="boldText"> Object </span>: An Object is an identifiable entity with some
            characteristics and behavior. An Object is an instance of a Class.
            When a class is defined, no<br />
            memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is
            created) memory is allocated. <br />
            <span class="boldText">Class </span>: The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented
            programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data type, which
            holds its own data<br />
            members and member functions, which can be accessed & used by
            creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint
            for an object. For<br />
            Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with
            different names and brand but all of them will share some common
            properties <br />like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit,
            Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed
            limits, mileage are their properties.

            The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics
            from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of
            the most important <br />feature of Object Oriented Programming.
            Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class
            is called Sub class or Derived Class.<br />
            Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by sub class
            is called Base Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we have to
            write the functions<br />
            only one time instead of three times as we have inherited rest of
            the three classes from base class(Vehicle).

            The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we
            can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be
            displayed in <br />more than one form. A real-life example of
            polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different
            characteristics. Like a man at the same time <br />is a father, a
            husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior
            in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
            Polymorphism<br />
            is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented
            Programming.

        <p class="paraContainer">
          Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature
          of object oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying
          only<br />
          essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction
          refers to providing only essential information about the data to the
          outside world, hiding <br />the background details or
          implementation.
        </p>
        <p class="paraContainer">
          Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only
          knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car
          or applying<br />
          brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing
          accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about
          the inner<br />
          mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
          etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
        </p>
        <p class="paraContainer">
          <span class="boldText">Abstraction using Classes</span>: We can implement Abstraction in C++ using
          classes. Class helps us to group data members and member functions
          using<br />
          available access specifiers. A Class can decide which data member
          will be visible to outside world and which is not.
        </p>
        <p class="paraContainer">
          <span class="boldText"> Abstraction in Header files</span>: One more type of abstraction in C++ can
          be header files. For example, consider the pow() method present in
          math.h <br />header file. Whenever we need to calculate power of a
          number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h
          header file and pass the<br />numbers as arguments without knowing
          the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually
          calculating power of numbers.

      <div id="EncapsulationContainer">
        <div class="titleContainer">
          <p>Encapsulation</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paraContainer">
          In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and
          information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming,<br />
          Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the
          functions that manipulates them. Consider a real life example of
          encapsulation, in a <br />company there are different sections like
          the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The
          finance section handles all the financial <br />transactions and
          keep records of all the data related to finance. Similarly the sales
          section handles all the sales related activities and keep records of
          <br />all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some
          reason an official from finance section needs all the data about
          sales in a particular<br />
          month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data
          of sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer
          in the sales section <br />and then request him to give the
          particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of
          sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped
          under a single name “sales section”.<br />
          Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. As using
          encapsulation also hides the data. In the above example the data of
          any of the section <br />like sales, finance or accounts is hidden
          from any other section.<br />
          In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access
          modifiers.
